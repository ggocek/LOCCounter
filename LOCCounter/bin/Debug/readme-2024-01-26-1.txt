LOC Counter, copyright (c) 2024, Gary Gocek
All rights reserved.
Count lines of code via a graphical user interface or the command line.

If either programs fails to start, it's probably because the EXE can't find the
DLL or config file.

LOCCounter.exe, Sloc.dll and LOCCounter.exe.config should all be in the same
folder.

LOCCounterStd.exe, Sloc.dll and LOCCounterStd.exe.config should all be in the
same folder.

These files can be placed together in one folder (Sloc.dll is the same for both
programs).

Users may edit the config files as needed. The programs have no option to
restore the original settings, but you can get to this free and open-source
software via https://www.gocek.org/software/.

No "installation" is necessary - just run the EXEs. No registry keys are used.
LOCCounter.exe remembers the window size and location. The operating system
modifies a user.config file to support this, depending on the OS.
